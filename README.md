#Engineering PYTHON Test

You're supposed to build a Realtime Chat Server using Django Rest Framework, so It can be utilised on the front-end. Some specifications for the project are as follow:

There should be Authentication, which consists of Login, Sing-up, Register, Forgot Password, Check session, Refresh session and so on. You can build it custom or use any library for achieving the goal.
The options for chat can be multiple:
One-to-one Chat
Group Chat
The chat should be realtime.
The chat should be accessible at a later time/stored in db as well.  
The front-end should be minimal to test the app. There would be No points for the UI but for functionality.You can use any front-end technology or plain HTML/JS. Simple text boxes would work.
Code requirements:

The code should be class based.
You are free to create as many apps, models, serialisers, and views required but More points would be given to the refined code.
The time and space complexity for each function/view/serialised should be minimal.
The admin panel should contain all the models. And the APIs should be interface-able via direct path in DEBUG mode. 
The code should be properly structured and readable. 
Submission: You would be added to a Github repo for front-end and backend attached below:

Backend: https://github.com/punchagency/punch-django-backend-test Frontend: https://github.com/punchagency/punch-frontend-test

You would be added to the Github repos mentioned above.
You can create a branch by your name.
You are supposed to push your daily updates to that branch.
Your daily/weekly progress would be based on the code available on Github.
The time available to complete the test would be one week.
Grading: The candidate with the maximum BE functionality would receive the highest score, and the FE can be minimal. There is no score at all for the UI.
